Q.Check the below given code, if there are any issues, fix them and explain the output

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {

  if (num % 2 === 0) {

    acc.evens.push(num);

  } else {

    acc.odds.push(num);

  }

  return acc;

});



console.log(result);



Answer=>
The given code has a minor issue, which can be easily fixed. 
The initial value for the accumulator (acc) in the reduce() method is missing. 
We need to provide an initial value to avoid unintended behavior. 
Additionally, it is recommended to provide an initial value, especially when using object literals to avoid any potential issues with prototype pollution.

Code To be Fix=>

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const result = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    acc.evens.push(num);
  } else {
    acc.odds.push(num);
  }
  return acc;
}, { evens: [], odds: [] });
console.log(result);




Output=>
{ evens: [2, 4], odds: [1, 3, 5] }
